## 🔄 How It Works

### Restore All
1. User clicks green "Restore All" button
2. Confirmation: "Restore all X file(s)?"
3. If Yes → Loop through each deleted file
4. Call `controller.restore_file()` for each
5. Show results: "Successfully restored all X file(s)!"
6. Refresh table (files move to uploaded files)

### Erase All
1. User clicks red "Erase All" button
2. **First confirmation**: "⚠️ PERMANENTLY delete all X file(s)?"
3. If Yes → **Second confirmation**: "LAST CHANCE! Absolutely sure?"
4. If Yes again → Loop through each deleted file
5. Call `controller.permanent_delete_file()` for each
6. Show results: "Successfully erased all X file(s) permanently"
7. Refresh table (should be empty)

2. **Selective Operations**: Checkboxes to select specific files for bulk operations
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Restore), Ctrl+Shift+E (Erase)
4. **Undo Window**: 5-second window to undo Erase All
5. **Confirmation Bypass**: Hold Shift while clicking to skip first confirmation (for power users)
6. **Statistics**: Show total size of files to be restored/erased
