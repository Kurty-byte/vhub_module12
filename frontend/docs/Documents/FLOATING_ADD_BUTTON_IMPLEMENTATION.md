# Floating Add Button Implementation

## Summary
Successfully added floating action buttons (FAB) with the `add.png` icon to both the "Uploaded Files" and "Collections" interfaces.

## Changes Made

### 1. Icon Utils Enhancement (`utils/icon_utils.py`)
Added a new helper function to create floating action buttons:
- **Function**: `create_floating_add_button(callback=None)`
- **Features**:
  - Circular button (56x56 pixels)
  - Uses `add.png` icon (32x32)
  - Blue color scheme (#0078D4)
  - Hover and pressed states
  - Positioned in bottom-right corner
  - Fallback to "+" text if icon fails to load

### 2. Uploaded Files View (`Shared/uploaded_files_view.py`)
Added floating button to the Uploaded Files interface:
- Imported `create_floating_add_button` utility
- Created floating button instance that calls `handle_add_file()`
- Added `resizeEvent()` to handle window resizing
- Added `position_floating_button()` to maintain button position
- Button stays 20px from bottom-right corner
- Button is always on top of other elements

### 3. Collection View (`Shared/collection_view.py`)
Added floating button to the Collections interface:
- Imported `create_floating_add_button` utility
- Created floating button instance that calls `handle_add_file()`
- Added `resizeEvent()` to handle window resizing
- Added `position_floating_button()` to maintain button position
- Button stays 20px from bottom-right corner
- Button is always on top of other elements

## Features

### Visual Design
- **Shape**: Circular button (56x56 pixels)
- **Icon**: `add.png` from assets folder (scaled to 32x32)
- **Colors**:
  - Normal: #0078D4 (Microsoft Blue)
  - Hover: #106EBE (Darker Blue)
  - Pressed: #005A9E (Even Darker Blue)
- **Position**: Bottom-right corner with 20px margin
- **Tooltip**: "Add File"

### Functionality
- **Action**: Opens the file upload dialog when clicked
- **Context-Aware**:
  - In Uploaded Files: Uploads to general storage
  - In Collections: Uploads to that specific collection
- **Responsive**: Button repositions automatically on window resize
- **Always Accessible**: Button stays on top (z-index wise)

## User Experience

### Before
- Users had to use the "Add File" button in the header to upload files

### After
- Users now have TWO options:
  1. Header "Add File" button (existing)
  2. Floating action button in bottom-right corner (new)
- The floating button is more accessible and follows modern UI patterns
- Similar to Gmail's compose button or WhatsApp's new chat button

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Test**: Verify the button appears in bottom-right corner
2. **Click Test**: Confirm clicking opens the file upload dialog
3. **Resize Test**: Resize the window and verify button stays positioned correctly
4. **Upload Test**: Upload a file using the floating button
5. **Collection Test**: Test in different collections to ensure context is maintained
6. **Icon Test**: Verify the add.png icon loads correctly

## Technical Notes

- The button uses PyQt6's absolute positioning
- `raise_()` method ensures button is always on top
- `resizeEvent()` is overridden to handle dynamic positioning
- No changes to existing "Add File" functionality
- Both buttons call the same `handle_add_file()` method
