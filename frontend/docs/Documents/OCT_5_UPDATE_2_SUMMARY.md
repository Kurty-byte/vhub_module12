# October 5, 2025 - Second Update Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Overview

**Fixed 2 critical bugs**:
1. âœ… Restored files now appear in AdminDash uploaded files table
2. âœ… File editing now works completely (filename, category, description, icon)

---

## Problem 1: Restored Files Not Showing

**What was broken**: File restoration worked but didn't show in AdminDash

**Why**: Signal wasn't propagating: `FileDetailsDialog â†’ DeletedFilesView â†’ AdminDash`

**Fix**: Added `file_restored` signal and proper connection chain

**Result**: Files instantly appear in uploaded files table after restoration

---

## Problem 2: File Editing Broken

**What was broken**:
- Filename changes didn't save
- Icon showed "?" after editing  
- Extension not updating
- No backend update happening (TODO in code)

**Why**: No `update_file()` method existed in controller

**Fix**: 
- Added `update_file()` method to DocumentController
- Added `_update_file_in_collections()` helper
- Rewrote `save_changes()` in FileDetailsDialog
- Proper UI updates after save

**Result**: All file edits work perfectly and sync everywhere

---

## Code Changes

**3 files modified**:
1. `document_controller.py` - Added update methods (~95 lines)
2. `file_details_dialog.py` - New signal + rewrite save (~52 lines)
3. `deleted_files_view.py` - Connect restoration signal (~7 lines)

**Total**: ~154 lines added/modified
