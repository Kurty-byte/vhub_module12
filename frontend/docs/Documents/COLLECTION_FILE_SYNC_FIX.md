# Collection-File Synchronization Fix

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Category**: Critical Bug Fix

---

## üêõ Problem Statement

### Issue 1: Files Persisting in Collections After Deletion
When deleting a file from within a collection view:
- ‚úÖ File was removed from `uploaded_files` array
- ‚úÖ File was added to `deleted_files` array  
- ‚úÖ Physical file was moved to RecycleBin
- ‚ùå **File remained in collection's `files` array**

**Result**: Deleted files would persist in collection views despite being in "Manage Deleted Files".

### Issue 2: Files Not Restoring to Original Collections
When restoring a file from "Manage Deleted Files":
- ‚úÖ File was moved back to `uploaded_files`
- ‚úÖ Physical file was restored from RecycleBin
- ‚ùå **File did NOT reappear in its original collection(s)**

**Result**: Users had to manually re-add restored files to collections.

## üîß Solution Implemented

### Fix #1: Auto-Remove from Collections on Deletion

**Modified**: `document_controller.py` - `delete_file()` method

**Changes**:
1. Added tracking of which collections contain the file BEFORE deletion
2. Store collection membership in `_original_collections` field
3. Remove file from ALL collections after moving to recycle bin

**New Method Added**:
```python
def _get_collections_containing_file(self, filename: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Get list of collection names that contain a specific file.
    Returns: list of collection names
    """
```

**Flow**:
```
User Deletes File
    ‚Üì
Get collections containing file ‚Üí ["Syllabus", "Memo"]
    ‚Üì
Store in file_to_delete['_original_collections']
    ‚Üì
Move to deleted_files array
    ‚Üì
Move physical file to RecycleBin
    ‚Üì
Call remove_file_from_all_collections(filename)
    ‚Üì
File removed from ALL collection views ‚úÖ
```

### Fix #2: Auto-Restore to Original Collections

**Modified**: `document_controller.py` - `restore_file()` method

**Changes**:
1. Read `_original_collections` field from deleted file metadata
2. Call `add_file_to_collection()` for each original collection
3. Remove `_original_collections` field after restoration

**Flow**:
```
User Restores File
    ‚Üì
Read original_collections = ["Syllabus", "Memo"]
    ‚Üì
Move to uploaded_files array
    ‚Üì
Restore physical file from RecycleBin
    ‚Üì
For each collection in original_collections:
    ‚Üí add_file_to_collection(collection_name, file_data)
    ‚Üì
File reappears in original collection views ‚úÖ
```

### Fix #3: Enhanced Permanent Deletion

**Modified**: `document_controller.py` - `permanent_delete_file()` method

**Changes**:
- Added safety call to `remove_file_from_all_collections()`
- Ensures orphaned files are cleaned up even if soft delete missed them

## üìã Technical Details

### New Helper Method

**Location**: `frontend/views/Documents/controller/document_controller.py`

```python
def _get_collections_containing_file(self, filename: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Scans all collections in collections_data.json
    Returns list of collection names containing the specified file
    
    Example return: ["Syllabus", "Memo", "Forms"]
    """
```

### Modified Methods

#### 1. `delete_file(filename, timestamp=None)`
**Lines modified**: ~145-152

**Before**:
```python
# Save updated data
with open(files_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

return True, f"File '{filename}' moved to recycle bin"
```

**After**:
```python
# Save updated data
with open(files_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

# CRITICAL FIX: Remove file from all collections
success, msg, count = self.remove_file_from_all_collections(filename)
if success and count > 0:
    print(f"‚úì Removed '{filename}' from {count} collection(s)")

return True, f"File '{filename}' moved to recycle bin"
```

#### 2. `restore_file(filename, deleted_at=None)`
**Lines modified**: ~190-215

**Before**:
```python
# Remove deletion metadata
file_to_restore.pop('deleted_at', None)
file_to_restore.pop('deleted_by', None)
uploaded_files.append(file_to_restore)

# Save updated data
with open(files_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

return True, f"File '{filename}' restored successfully"
```

**After**:
```python
# Get original collections
original_collections = file_to_restore.get('_original_collections', [])

# Remove deletion metadata
file_to_restore.pop('deleted_at', None)
file_to_restore.pop('deleted_by', None)
file_to_restore.pop('_original_collections', None)
uploaded_files.append(file_to_restore)

# Save updated data
with open(files_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

# CRITICAL FIX: Restore to original collections
if original_collections:
    for collection_name in original_collections:
        self.add_file_to_collection(collection_name, file_to_restore)
    return True, f"File restored to {len(original_collections)} collection(s)"

return True, f"File '{filename}' restored successfully"
```

#### 3. `permanent_delete_file(filename, deleted_at=None)`
**Lines modified**: ~260-265

**Added**:
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Also remove from collections (safety check)
success, msg, count = self.remove_file_from_all_collections(filename)
if success and count > 0:
    print(f"‚úì Removed '{filename}' from {count} collection(s)")
```

### Enhanced Method

**Location**: `frontend/views/Documents/controller/document_controller.py`

```python
def remove_file_from_all_collections(self, filename: str) -> Tuple[bool, str, int]:
    """
    Remove a file from ALL collections (used when file is deleted).
    
    Searches through all collections and removes any instances of the file.
    Returns count of affected collections for logging.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (success: bool, message: str, count: int)
    """
```

## üìä Data Structure Changes

### files_data.json Enhancement

**New Field Added**: `_original_collections`

**Example**:
```json
{
  "deleted_files": [
    {
      "filename": "important.txt",
      "time": "06:06 pm",
      "extension": "txt",
      "deleted_at": "2025-10-05 18:06:12",
      "deleted_by": "admin",
      "_original_collections": ["Syllabus", "Memo"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Purpose**: Tracks which collections contained the file before deletion, enabling restoration to original locations.

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Test Scenario 1: Delete from Collection
1. Add a file to "Syllabus" collection
2. Open file details and click "Delete File"
3. **Verify**:
   - ‚úÖ File disappears from Syllabus collection immediately
   - ‚úÖ File appears in "Manage Deleted Files"
   - ‚úÖ Console shows: "Removed 'filename' from 1 collection(s)"

### Test Scenario 2: Restore to Collection
1. Go to "Manage Deleted Files"
2. Restore a file that was in "Syllabus"
3. **Verify**:
   - ‚úÖ File disappears from deleted files
   - ‚úÖ File reappears in Syllabus collection
   - ‚úÖ Console shows: "Restored 'filename' to collection 'Syllabus'"

### Test Scenario 3: File in Multiple Collections
1. Add same file to "Syllabus" AND "Memo"
2. Delete the file from one collection
3. **Verify**:
   - ‚úÖ File removed from BOTH collections
   - ‚úÖ Console shows: "Removed 'filename' from 2 collection(s)"
4. Restore the file
5. **Verify**:
   - ‚úÖ File reappears in BOTH collections
   - ‚úÖ Message shows: "File restored to 2 collection(s)"

### Test Scenario 4: Permanent Delete
1. Delete a file from collection
2. Go to "Manage Deleted Files"
3. Permanently delete the file
4. **Verify**:
   - ‚úÖ File completely removed from system
   - ‚úÖ No orphaned entries in collections
